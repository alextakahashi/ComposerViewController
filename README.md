> TL;DR Present a User Text Input View Controller 

This project was inspired by a few hackathon designs I've seen this year while mentoring for [Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io/).  The modal text input design pattern is used to allow users to post/save text.

## Interactions
* **Post Text** - *Save* ‚úÖ
* **Discard Text** - *Trash* üóë

## Getting Started

1. ‚úÖ  Fork the Project
2. ‚úÖ  Build + Run 
3. ‚úÖ  Tap to Present the View Controller
4. ‚úÖ. Start Composing üñã

## Try it Yourself

Update any of these `FirstViewController`, `SecondViewController`, or `ThirdViewController` and add more than just a different background color.

```swift

class ViewController: UIViewController, ComposerViewControllerDelegate {

    ... 

    // MARK: ComposerViewControllerDelegate

    func composerViewControllerDidPost(viewController: ComposerViewController, model: ComposerModel) {
      // User Tapped "Post" Button.  Save the model.
    }
    
    func composerViewControllerWillDiscardPost(viewController: ComposerViewController, discardHandlerShouldDiscard: @escaping (Bool) -> ()) {
      // User wants to discard post, prompt an alert if necessary
    }
}


```
